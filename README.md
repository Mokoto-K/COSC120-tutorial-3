A rather big project in java for me so early into learning it.

This did take 4 2hr sessions to complete and I feel I should have finished it in two at most.
All it is, is a fairly simple two class program. The first class is a dog class that keeps 
track of dog objects + has some basic methods for doing small things basic things, mostly
for practicing java. 
The second class has our main method and also contains a few other methods for:
- Reading datafiles
- Separating the data
- data manipulation
- writing data to different data structures
- getting user input
- comparing input to data in files
- .....
you get the picture here. Over all it was actually rewarding as it felt good to acheive this
after spending too many sessions doing it. This is week three work and I am only in week 1
but I have to get ahead cause week three ill probably have to take time off and so I wanna make
sure im atleast there before I do take a few days off.
